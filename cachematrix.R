## Inverse of a Matrix
## caching is used to inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly

## cache the inverse of matrix if it is not changed 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## computes the inverse of the matrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
